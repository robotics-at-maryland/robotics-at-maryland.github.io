R@M has exciting news! We will be adding HD video to our build process for our members to watch.


We chose to source a couple of these [security cameras](https://www.cctvcameraworld.com/security-cameras.html) as small lightweight cameras have many uses beyond surveillance. With the camera we have selected, we will be able to document our design and building process via high quality live RTSP video streams captured to our computer and blog posts. Sponsors, members, and robotics fans the world over will be able to follow our progress in creating our latest robot. We will link the streams and photos on our website. We will use a dome shaped [ip camera found on this page](https://www.cctvcameraworld.com/security-cameras.html) to optimize QUBO for low-light operation. Murky water and bad lighting in the competition pool have always proved a challenge for our team, but with the cameraâ€™s assistance we will overcome these hurdles.
